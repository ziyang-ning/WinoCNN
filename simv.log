Error loading vcs/2020.12-SP2-1

To prevent this in the future, Consider changing or unsetting the
SW_VCS variable.  This variable is likely to have been set in
the ~/.cshrc or ~/.software files.

Even better, try using environment modules described at
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/software/modules
In particular, execute these commands to run the default version:
  module load vcs
  vcs
(or use vcs/<version> in the module load command)
These versions are available (module avail vcs):
/usr/caen/misc/modules:
vcs/2017.03-SP1
vcs/2017.12-SP2-1
vcs/2020.03-SP1
vcs/2020.12-SP2-1
vcs/2022.06
vcs/2023.12-SP2-1

Would you like to try to run the default version of vcs (y/n)
